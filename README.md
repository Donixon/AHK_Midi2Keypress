# AHK_Midi2Keypress
In an attempt to simplify the code for ppl converting midi to keypress, I have consolidated to 1 file.
This ONLY works with midi input, there is NO midi output.
Takes midi input and converts to a keypress
There is a built in midi monitor that can be disabled when you don't need it anymore.
This will create a .ini file with the same name as the ahk file.
